###R tips and tricks
Curson inside a command and press f1 will open the help window.


```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
Avocado = read.csv("avocado.csv", header = T, sep = ",")
library(stargazer)
```



##Inspect, plot, and check descriptive statistics

```{r echo=FALSE}
names(Avocado)  
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
